# Snake-Game
The Snake Game project is a Java-based implementation of the classic Snake game. It employs the Swing library for creating a graphical user interface, providing an enhanced and interactive gaming experience. The objective of the game is to control a snake, guiding it across a grid to consume food and grow in length.
